# Uno-Game
A Uno game implemented in Python

Currently a placeholder but may be updated in the future.

## Installation

The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyuno-game/), and can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install pyuno-game
```

## Rules

Official Rules can be found [here](https://service.mattel.com/us/instruction_sheets.aspx).
Do note that there are many variations of the game (also known as Theme Packs) and the rules can be very different.
The target of this project is to implement the original uno game, and potentially allow for customisation as extensions.

Some of the most popular [citation needed] rules is listed below, and also can be found under [rules](rules/).

> Note: The last one above is wildly used by 3rd party websites including [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)#cite_note-UNO-6)
and [Mattel Wiki](https://mattel.fandom.com/wiki/UNO#cite_note-UNO-4), but it can't be found on the official website
(Although the file is still on the server, the product page offers a different version of the rules, which is also provided above (the third one)).
